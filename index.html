                At the time of writing, the Detroit Tigers have the chance to advance to the American League Championship Series (ALCS) tomorrow for the first time in over 10 years. This is coming after only having a 0.2% chance of making the playoffs in mid-August. I have been waiting for playoff baseball to return to Detroit for so long, and their stint in this year's playoffs has been nothing short of amazing. This team is very young, one of the youngest in baseball, but they have created many great moments within their run at the end the season and to start the playoffs. There is nothing that I cannot like about this team, and it makes it that much more special.

                My favorite part about the current Detroit Tigers is that there is not one set of players that they always have to rely on. It seems like every guy on the team has had his moment at some point during this run. A timely hit here or a strikeout there. No matter who it is, these young players are up for any challenge. However, I do have to give credit to Detroit's manager, A.J. Hinch. He has done an exceptional job putting players and the team in a position to succeed. Without his coaching, the Detroit Tigers are not currently in the American League Division Series (ALDS), or have a potential birth into the ALCS.

                The first half of Michigan State's football season may have not started out how I would have wanted. However, they have had some good moments within their losses that give myself, and hopefully other fans, hope for the future of Michigan State football. This team is lead by a young quarterback named Aidan Chiles. He has not been perfect throughout the first six games, but he has shown great potential. There are only a few more things he needs to learn and develop, and with that he could become one of the best quarterbacks in the nation. No matter what, he is an improvement of who we could have had at starting quarterback if it was not for Jonathan Smith taking over as the team's head coach. Coach Smith was Aidan Chiles coach at Oregon State, so he had great leverage in recuiting him to transfer to Michigan State.

                Even with the slow start to the season, I still enjoy watching the team take the field every Friday/Saturday. The electric plays they can create are awesome to experience. I take great pride in calling Michigan State my favorite college football team even when they are not on national headlines every week for exceptional play. I hope they continue to improve as the season continues. They have good chances to win in their remaining games, with one being against the team down the road, Michigan.
