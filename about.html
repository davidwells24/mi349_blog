                        My name is David Wells, and I am currently a senior attending Michigan State University. I am going for a bachelor's degree in the field of computer science. Before the world of computer science peaked my interest, I was studying electrical engineering before I realized it was not for me. With that period of time studying electrical engineering, I was on Michigan State's Solar Car team. There, I was apart of the sub-team working on integrating an electrical vehicle charger with the solar vehicle.

                        Outside of schooling, I am very involved with sports whether it be playing recreationally or watching it live. Detroit sports teams are among my favorite to watch along with Michigan State sports. My list of favorites, in order, includes:

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        It would be rare for me miss going to or watching a game from any of my top four favorite teams. Alongside sports, I enjoy collecting different things. Among my favorites to collect are physical copy's of video games with creative artwork on it, tickets from different events I attend, and hats. Finally, I love to surround myself with family and friends. They are the people I want to be arround most because they are my biggest supporters and even better people.
